                                The Q-Team is a young queer vocal ensemble from Brussels, dedicated to the a cappella interpretation of music from pop/geek/nerd culture, particularly those with a connection to films, series, video games,
                                cartoons or social networks.
                            </p>
                            <p>Founded in 2023, the Q-Team now has a dozen members from the LGBTQI+ community or sharing their values, all united by the same passion for choral singing and the geek universe.</p>
                            <p>We rehearse every Tuesday evening in Saint-Gilles.</p>
                            <h3>Musical direction</h3>
                            <p>Quỳnh Lan writes the Q-Team's original arrangements and directs weekly rehearsals.</p>
                            <p>
                                A graduate in piano from Aulnay-sous-Bois’ CRD, choral conducting from Villeurbanne’s CRD and music composition from Paris’ CNSMD, she co-founded <a href="https://www.negitachi.fr/">Negitachi</a>, a geek
                                choir, in Paris in 2010. She also directed the Brussels choirs Zinnechoeur (2018-2020) and Tapalanote (2018-2023), before launching the project of a geek and queer vocal ensemble in August 2023: the Q-Team.

                        <span class="anchor" id="join-us">&nbsp;</span>
                        <h2 class="vl blue">Join us</h2>
                        <p>Recruitment takes place all year round, so it's still possible to join us!</p>
                        <h3>When and where do you rehearse?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We rehearse on Tuesday evenings from 8 to 10.30pm at the Pianofabriek, Rue du Fort 35, Saint-Gilles. Rehearsals are held in French, with occasional discussions in English, as our group is, like Brussels,
                            cosmopolitan.
                        </p>
                        <h3>What is your repertoire?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We perform a cappella versions of music from pop culture: music from films (such as Pirates of the Caribbean), series (Game of Thrones), video games (Tetris), anime (Evangelion), songs popularized on social
                            networks (Wellerman)&hellip;
                        </p>
                        <p>We sing mainly in English, Japanese and French, but we also occasionally sing purely in onomatopoeia when performing a vocal arrangement of purely instrumental music.</p>
                        <p>All arrangements are written by Quỳnh Lan, and each chorister can suggest ideas for the repertoire. We work on around 15 songs a year.</p>
                        <h3>What are the prerequisites?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We are looking for people who can sing in tune, who are motivated by our project, who share our values of inclusiveness and openness, and who are willing to rehearse at home listening to the audio recordings
                            provided, so that learning the songs happens more quickly in rehearsal. You don't need to be able to read music, or have any experience of choral singing. We do, however, ask for a certain investment: learning
                            all the songs by heart, and, ideally, attending all the weekly rehearsals, so as to prepare for the concerts in the best possible conditions.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How much does it cost to join?</h3>
                        <p>
                        Each member of the choir pays a membership fee to cover our costs (rental of the rehearsal room, remuneration of the musical director, writing of arrangements, etc.).</p>
                        <p>The membership fee is 250€ for the year, 175€
                            from January onwards, and 90€ for a quarter.
